## 1. Installation
This installation path has been tested on macOS and it relies on conda and pip package managers. 
1. Download the E2EDNA 2.0 package from this repository.
2. Register and download NUPACK package from http://www.nupack.org/downloads, find out the path to the downloaded package, such as ``~/Downloads/nupack-4.0.0.27/package``.
3. In the E2EDNA2 directory please modify the [macos_installation.sh](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/blob/JOSS/macos_installation.sh) script: update the path to NUPACK installation package (see step 2).
4. From the E2EDNA2 directory run ``source macos_installation.sh`` in command line to install a virtual environment "e2edna" and required dependences. Note that (e2edna) environment should be activated when the script finishes. 
   * Caveat: If the scripts fails to activate the environment automatically, this is likely because `conda activate e2edna` command gives an error such as "Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'".
   * To fix this issue, please, first remove the installed environment by ``conda remove --name e2edna --all`` in command line, then either replace the conda activation command in the script with `source activate /path-to-envs/e2edna`, e.g., `source activate ~/miniconda3/envs/e2edna` and run the script again 
   * *OR* run the commands one by one interactively in your terminal. 
5. Register and download MMB from https://simtk.org/projects/rnatoolbox. Place the "Installer.*version.OS*" folder, such as "Installer.3_0.OSX" into the E2EDNA2 directory. N.B.: Do not specify `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for macOS against the recommendations of the MMB installation guide. This is to avoid interference with the OpenMM module.
6. Update 3 paths in [main.py](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/blob/JOSS/main.py):
```
params['workdir'] = '/path-to-E2EDNA2-JOSS/localruns'                                # directory manually created to store all future jobs
params['mmb dir'] = '/path-to-E2EDNA2-JOSS/Installer.version.OS/lib'                 # path to MMB dylib files
params['mmb']     = '/path-to-E2EDNA2-JOSS/Installer.version.OS/bin/MMB-executable'  # path to MMB executable
```
## 2. Running a job
### Quickstart
* Set 3 paths in `params`, as indicated in step6 of [Installation](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/tree/JOSS#1-installation) section. Leave the other keys of `params` unchanged.
* Run the bash script [automate_tests.sh](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/blob/JOSS/automate_tests.sh) to test run all 8 modes automatically. Check out [Test runs](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/tree/JOSS#4-test-runs-inputs-and-outcomes) section for details. 
* All 8 modes take about 15 minutes to run on a macbook pro laptop and the outputs are saved in the work directory. We chose very simple systems for the the test-run and where ever docking is performed the docking configuration may or may not be found due to the limitations of the chosen system. Please note that a failure to find a docked configuration is not a failure of E2EDNA. 
* Alternatively, a single run can be carried out by run_num, mode, aptamer sequence, and ligand's structural file. For example,
```
python main.py --run_num=1 --mode='free aptamer' --aptamerSeq='TAATGTTAATTG' --ligand='False' --ligandType='' --ligandSeq=''
python main.py --run_num=2 --mode='full dock' --aptamerSeq='TAATGTTAATTG' --ligand='YQTQ.pdb' --ligandType='peptide' --ligandSeq='YQTQTNSPRRAR'
    
# --ligand='False'        # if no ligand. --ligandType and --ligandSeq will be ignored.
# --ligandType='peptide'  # or 'DNA' or 'RNA' or 'other'. Assuming 'other' ligand can be described by Amber14 force field.
# --ligandSeq=''          # if no sequence. For instance, when ligandType is 'other'
```
### Customizing parameters
* parameters passed as command line inputs:
  * `--run_num`: is used to name the folder for each job.
  * `--aptamerSeq`: DNA aptamer sequence (5'->3').
  * `--ligand`: PDB filename of target ligand; If no ligand, `--ligand='False'` and the following two inputs can be empty strings.
  * `--ligandType`: 'peptide' or 'DNA' or 'RNA' or 'other', assuming 'other' ligand can be described by force field used in MD simulation (default: Amber14).
  * `--ligandSeq`: target ligand's sequence (5'->3') if target ligand is a peptide or DNA or RNA. If `--ligandType='other'`, this input is empty string.
* A handful of parameters can be adjusted in [main.py](https://github.com/siminegroup/E2EDNA2/blob/JOSS/main.py) to allow for flexible control of the simulation conditions, including device platform (CPU or CUDA), solvent ionic strength, temperature, pH, implicit solvent, simulation force field, etc.

## 3. Functionality: Eight different modes of operation
E2EDNA 2.0 takes in a DNA aptamer sequence (5' to 3'), and optionally a short peptide or other small molecule, and returns details of the aptamer structure and binding behaviour.
This code implements several distinct operation modes so users may customize the level of computational cost and accuracy.

* `2d structure` &rarr; returns NUPACK analysis of aptamer secondary structure. Very fast, O(<1s). If using NUPACK, includes probability of observing a certain fold and of suboptimal folds within kT of the minimum.
* `3d coarse` &rarr; returns MMB fold of the best secondary structure. Fast, O(5-30 mins). Results in a strained 3D structure which obeys base pairing rules and certain stacking interactions.
* `3d smooth` &rarr; identical to '3d coarse', with a short MD relaxation in solvent. ~Less than double the cost of '3d coarse' depending on relaxation time.
* `coarse dock` &rarr; uses the 3D structure from '3d coarse' as the initial condition for a LightDock simulation, and returns best docking configurations and scores. Depending on docking parameters, adds O(5-30mins) to '3d coarse'.
* `smooth dock` &rarr; identical to 'coarse dock', instead using the relaxed structure from '3d smooth'. Similar cost to 'coarse dock'.
* `free aptamer` &rarr; fold the aptamer in MMB and run extended MD sampling to identify a representative, equilibrated 2D and 3D structure. Slow, O(hours).
* `full dock` &rarr; Return best docking configurations and scores from a LightDock run using the fully-equilibrated aptamer structure 'free aptamer'. Similar cost (LightDock is relatively cheap)
* `full binding` &rarr; Same steps as 'full dock', with follow-up extended MD simulation of the best binding configuration. Slowest, O(hours).
## 4. Test runs: inputs and outcomes
