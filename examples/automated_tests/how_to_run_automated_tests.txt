There are two sets of automated tests:
(1) automated_tests.sh + simu_config_automated_tests.yaml
(2) automated_tests_no_NUPACK_MMB + simu_config_automated_tests_no_NUPACK_MMB.yaml

Prerequisite: 
(a) Must have created a conda environment "e2edna" using the installation script "macos_installation.sh".
(b) For the first set of tests, must have NUPACK and MMB modules available. The "macos_installation.sh" script provides instructions on setting up NUPACK and MMB as well.

To carry out either one of the tests, 
- firstly, copy the corresponding two files (.sh and .yaml) to the codebase directory (containing scripts like main.py).

- Secondly, in command line run:
	$ bash automated_test.sh

or  $ bash automated_tests_no_NUPACK_MMB.sh
