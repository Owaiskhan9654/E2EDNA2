## How to Contribute to E2EDNA Development
E2EDNA is an ongoing project. We welcome anyone who wants to contribute, whether by adding a feature, fixing a bug, improving documentation, and etc. 
The process is quite simple, as follows.

Option1: start with an issue report to describe any issue or suggestion. Then we can discuss significance, solutions, designs, and etc.

Option2: directly contact us ([The Simine Group](https://www.siminegroup.ca/)).

The next step is to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) with the code changes. 
If necessary, put the "WIP" in the title of the pull request to indicate it is still work in progress. 
Once the pull request is reviewed, tested and approved, it will be merged. 
Congratulations on a succesful contribution!

Of course, you are more than welcome to fork this project, develop it on your own, then eventually contribute back to this repository. 
We believe that it will be beneficial to all users if the main development activities are centered around this repository.
